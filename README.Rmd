# tiltPlot

The goal of tiltPlot is to provide plots for the TILT project. 

Here is a prototype of what this package might eventually do.

## Example

```{r}
library(tibble)
library(networkD3)
library(dplyr)
```


```{r}
toy_data <- tibble::tribble(
  ~bank, ~amount, ~amount_of_disctinct_products, ~PCTR_risk_category, ~tilt_sec,
  "A", 1, 2, "low", "sector_a",
  "B", 2, 1, "medium", "sector_b",
)

toy_data
```

```{r}
plot_sankey(toy_data)
```
